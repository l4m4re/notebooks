    "the circuit level Faraday law with the fundamental medium model, which resulted\n",
    "in wave equations that were not invariant to the good old Galilean coordinate\n",
    "transform. And it is this mistake that eventually led to the Lorentz transform,\n",

    "Sure, let's work this out step-by-step by considering the gravitational force in terms of the gradient of the square of the electric field, as suggested by the principle described by Richard Feynman.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electric Field and Its Units\n",
    "1. **Electric Field ($ \\vec{E} $)**: Typically, the electric field has units of $\\text{N/C}$ (newtons per coulomb) or $\\text{V/m}$ (volts per meter). However, in your context, you are considering $ \\vec{E} $ to have units of velocity $\\text{m/s}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Gradient of the Square of the Electric Field\n",
    "3. **Gradient of $ \\vec{E}^2 $**: The gradient operator $ \\nabla $ has units of $1/\\text{m}$. Therefore, applying the gradient to $ \\vec{E}^2 $, which has units of $\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2$, gives us:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Mass Density and Force Density\n",
    "4. **Mass Density ($ \\rho $)**: The mass density has units of $\\text{kg}/\\text{m}^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Force Density**: To get the force density, we multiply the mass density $ \\rho $ by the gradient of the square of the electric field:\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "In this model, we interpret the gravitational force density in terms of the mass density multiplied by the gradient of the square of the electric field.

    "\n",
    "Yes, using $ \\vec{E} \\cdot \\vec{E} $ is indeed a more precise and conventional notation for representing the square of the magnitude of the electric field. This dot product notation clearly indicates that we are dealing with the scalar quantity obtained from the vector field.\n",

This way, the notation clearly conveys that we are considering the magnitude squared of the electric field vector, ensuring clarity and correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Expression\n",
    "To summarize, the gravitational force density field can be expressed as:\n",

    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Should we add a minus sign, since Feymann says the dielectric is drawn toward a region of stronger field, while the gradient points in the other direction?\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",

    "Yes, adding a minus sign would align with Feynman's description that the dielectric is drawn toward a region of stronger field, which implies the force is directed opposite to the gradient of the electric field squared.
