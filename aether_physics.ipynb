    "Obviously, this way we can describe higher order time derivatives in three\n",
    "dimensions, which was heretofore impossible.\n",

    "The advantage of this method is that the resulting potential fields are uniquely\n",

    "multiplying by a few constants, we are sure the fields thus defined are 100%\n",
    "mathematically correct and consistent and free of singularities as well. \n",

    "Another advantage of this method is that there are only three units of\n",
    "measurement, the meter $[m]$, the second $[s]$ and the kilogram $[kg]$, which\n",
    "allows for the straightforward description of the dynamics of the superfluid\n",
    "medium and the integration of the electromagnetic domain with the domain of\n",
    "fluid dynamics, provided we are able to relate the units of measurement used in\n",

    "### Comparison of New Model with Maxwell\n",

    "\n",
    "In the new model, the electric and magnetic fields are treated more rigorously by distinguishing between their **linear** (irrotational) and **angular** (rotational) components. This is done by utilizing a second-order framework, where the vector potential is defined similarly to how it is in fluid dynamics, rather than the way Maxwell defines it. The key distinction in this model is that the fields are decomposed in line with the **Helmholtz theorem**, which separates vector fields into scalar and vector potentials based on the **vector Laplacian**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **Maxwell's equations** mix the contributions from both a scalar potential $ \\Phi $ and a vector potential $ \\vec{A} $ in the expression for the electric field:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{E} = -\\nabla \\Phi - \\frac{\\partial \\vec{A}}{\\partial t}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "While mathematically valid, this formulation combines two fundamentally different physical phenomena—**linear behavior** (described by the gradient of the scalar potential) and **angular behavior** (described by the curl of the vector potential). This is akin to \"adding apples and oranges,\" where the resulting expression lacks clear physical meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the new model, these components are kept separate, respecting the different physical processes they describe:\n",
    "- The **linear component** of a field is represented by the gradient of a scalar potential, capturing compressive or expansive behavior.\n",
    "- The **angular component** is represented by the curl of a vector potential, describing rotational or swirling motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "By preserving this distinction, the new model avoids the inconsistencies in Maxwell’s equations, where the electric field is described as a superposition of scalar and vector potentials. This second-order formulation provides a clearer, more consistent physical description of the electromagnetic field, ensuring that linear and angular dynamics are treated as separate entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while Maxwell’s equations provide a mathematically valid formulation, the new model offers a more physically consistent framework by rigorously separating linear and angular components, avoiding the blending of different types of behavior and ensuring adherence to fundamental principles of vector calculus."
