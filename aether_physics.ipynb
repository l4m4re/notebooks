    "planetary bodies through the aether would result in disturbances of the aether,\n",
    "which would influence the speed of light and that should be detectable. When\n",
    "that turned out not to be the case, it unfortunately was the aether theory that\n",

    "To make matters worse, it turns out that Maxwell made the mistake of entangling\n",
    "the circuit level Faraday law with the fundamental medium model, which resulted\n",
    "in wave equations that were not invariant to the good old Galilean coordinate\n",
    "transform. And it is this mistake that eventually led to the Lorentz transform,\n",

    "mathematically correct and consistent and free of singularities as well. \n",

    "Another advantage of this method is that there are only three units of\n",
    "measurement, the meter $[m]$, the second $[s]$ and the kilogram $[kg]$, which\n",
    "allows for the straightforward description of the dynamics of the superfluid\n",

    "provided we are able reproduce equations like Coulomb's law and the Lorentz\n",
