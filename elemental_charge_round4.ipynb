    "# Elemental charge and the fine structure constant\n",

    "This is accomplished by assuming this elemental particle to exist in the shape\n",

    "It is shown that from these equations, both the toroidal radius $R$ as well as\n",
    "the hollow core radius $r$ of such an elemental vortex ring particle can be\n",
    "computed, as well as their ratio $\\epsilon = r/R$. \n",

    "in wave equations that were not invariant to the good old Galilean coordinate\n",
    "transform. And it is this mistake that eventually led to the Lorentz transform,\n",

    "dimensions, which was heretofore impossible.\n",

    "The advantage of this method is that the resulting potential fields are uniquely\n",

    "multiplying by a few constants, we are sure the fields thus defined are 100%\n",
    "mathematically correct and consistent and free of singularities as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of this method is that there are only three units of\n",
    "measurement, the meter $[m]$, the second $[s]$ and the kilogram $[kg]$, which\n",
    "allows for the straightforward description of the dynamics of the superfluid\n",
    "medium and the integration of the electromagnetic domain with the domain of\n",
    "fluid dynamics, provided we are able to relate the units of measurement used in\n",
    "the electromagnetic domain to those used in the superfluid model, but also\n",

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Momentum**:\n",
    "   - The linear momentum $ P $ depends on the product of $\\pi^2 \\epsilon^2$, the square of the major radius $ R $, and the dynamic viscosity $\\eta$.\n",
    "   - This indicates that the linear momentum scales with the square of the size of the vortex ring and the viscosity of the fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Angular Momentum**:\n",
    "   - The angular momentum $ L $ includes contributions from both the toroidal and poloidal rotations.\n",
    "   - The term $\\frac{1}{n \\epsilon^2}$ shows how the angular momentum is influenced by the ratio of the angular velocities and the geometry of the vortex ring, specifically the relationship between the poloidal and toroidal radii.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interesting Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimensional Consistency**:\n",
    "   - Both expressions are dimensionally consistent, with $ P $ having units of momentum $(kg·m/s)$ and $ L $ having units of angular momentum $(kg·m$^2$/s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Geometric Influence**:\n",
    "   - The parameter $\\epsilon$ (the ratio of the minor to major radius) plays a critical role in both the linear and angular momentum, showing how the shape of the vortex ring influences its dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Superfluid Properties**:\n",
    "   - The substitution $ \\Gamma = \\nu = k = \\frac{\\eta}{\\rho} $ highlights the unique properties of superfluids, where the circulation is directly related to the kinematic viscosity, linking microscopic and macroscopic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of ring vortices in superfluids and how their geometry and intrinsic properties, like viscosity, influence their linear and angular momentum.\n",
