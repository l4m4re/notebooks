\section{Citations}
\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}

A single citation is here: \cite{eddy}. Multiple citations are as follows \cite{bondi,Pez,La2}. A citation containing a comment is \cite[see p.\,5]{eddy}

%%%%%%%% the \cite{eddy} command generates citation number proceeded from
%%%%%%%% the label \bibitem{eddy} in the bibliography list

\section{Equations}
\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}

Here is a manual-numbered equation
$$
r\,= \sqrt{dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2}}.
\eqno \mbox{(1.1)}
$$

Here is an automatic-numbered equation
\begin{equation}
r\,= \sqrt{dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2}}.
\end{equation}

Here is an unnumbered equation
$$
r\,= \sqrt{dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2}}.
$$


Here is a double-line equation, typeset to the left side
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
%
\displaystyle
ds^{2}\,= L(r)dt^{2} - M(r)(dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2}) -\\[+8pt]  % 1st row
%
\displaystyle
- N(r)(xdx + ydy + zdz)^{2}, \\% 2nd row
\end{array}
$$


Here are automatic-designed brackets
\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\mathrm{D} N^\alpha}{ds}\right),\quad
\left[ \frac{\mathrm{D} N^\alpha}{ds}\right],\quad
\left\{ \frac{\mathrm{D} N^\alpha}{ds}\right\},
\end{equation}
where you need in an ``empty'' bracket, if you feel to insert one-side brackets. For instance: $\left( \right.$.



Here are hand-designed brackets
\begin{equation}
\bigl( \frac{\mathrm{D} N^\alpha}{ds}\bigr),\quad
\Bigl( \frac{\mathrm{D} N^\alpha}{ds}\Bigr),\quad
\biggl( \frac{\mathrm{D} N^\alpha}{ds}\biggr) , 
\label{gensol}
\end{equation}
where is no need to insert an ``empty'' bracket, so you can mere type
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{D} N^\alpha}{ds} =
\Bigl\{ K^\alpha ; 0.
\end{equation}


%%%%%%%% [+8pt] is intendation following after the row
%%%%%%%% \displaystyle is normalsize in the fractions

%%%%%%%% this equation will be typeset to right, if use
%%%%%%%% {rr} argument istead {ll} in the preamble of the array

%%%%%%%% there is so many rows available as you feel

\section{Formulae in text}
\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}

Take operators in the \,{}\, brackets in the inline formulae, for compact typing: \,{=}\, gives $w \,{=}\, c^2 $. Write down \dots \ instead of ...

\section{Items}
\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}


An unnumbered item containing bullets is:
\begin{itemize}
\item The most general metric
\item The most general metric
\item The most general metric
\end{itemize}


Here is an unnumbered item:
\begin{itemize}
\item [] The most general metric
\item [] The most general metric
\item [] The most general metric
\end{itemize}


An Arabic-numbered item:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The most general metric
\item The most general metric
\item The most general metric
\end{enumerate}


A your-style numbered item:
\begin{itemize}
\item [A1] The most general metric
\item [A2] The most general metric
\item [A3] The most general metric
\end{itemize}


A double-level item (it is numbered, a sample):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The most general metric
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The most general metric
  \item The most general metric
  \item The most general metric
  \end{enumerate}
\item The most general metric
\item The most general metric
\item The most general metric
\end{enumerate}

\section{References to text pages}
\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}


If you like to refer a numbered formula in the {equation} environment, input \label{nickname-of-the-formula} into the formula, so you will need to type (\ref{nickname-of-the-formula}) in the text instead of (12), for instance. Such reference will automatically be changed keeping the real number of the reference, if you reorder/remove/add formulae.

It works in only the {equation} environment --- auto numbered formulae.



\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}
\section{Cross-references}
\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}


Insert \label{myidea} in your text, then you have that page number where your label \pageref{myidea} appeared. For instance:

The general equation, see formula (\ref{gensol}) in page~\pageref{gensol}, is very good.

Don't use two or more same labels in the same document!



\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}
\section{Brackets, dividing paragraphs, etc.}
\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}


The commands `` and '' produce open-closed brackets: ``notation''.

Instead of \par one uses empty space(s) between paragraphs, because it is more visible.

Any sequence following a formula starts new paragraph.

If a paragraph ends by a formula, the next paragraph starts from the first line indented.

Text and space in formulae:
$$
\mbox{here is a text in this formula}\quad
\mbox{small space}\qquad \mbox{big space}
$$


\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}
\section{Spaces and dashes}
\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}


Einstein-Infeld, space-like, Bohr-like include single dash.

Page numbers 3--27 include double dash.

Thin spaces in text: v.\,13, no.\,24.

American long dash is---like this case.

British long dash is --- like this one.

We assumed the British case in our Journal.

\section{Normal size inside fractions}
\markright{Your Full Names.  Short Title of Your Paper}


Use ``displaystyle'' command before every line:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle
R_{p}(r) = \sqrt{\sqrt{C(r)}\left(\sqrt{C(r)} - \alpha\right)} + \\[+12pt]
\displaystyle
+ \;\alpha\ln\left|\frac{\sqrt{\sqrt{C(r)}} + \sqrt{\sqrt{C(r)} - 
\alpha}}{\sqrt{\alpha}}\right|.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Compare it with follows
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
%  \displaystyle
R_{p}(r) = \sqrt{\sqrt{C(r)}\left(\sqrt{C(r)} - \alpha\right)} + \\[+12pt]
%  \displaystyle
+ \;\alpha\ln\left|\frac{\sqrt{\sqrt{C(r)}} + \sqrt{\sqrt{C(r)} - 
\alpha}}{\sqrt{\alpha}}\right|.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
