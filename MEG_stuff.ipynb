    "Ferrite cores like N87 saturate at relatively low magnetic flux densities (around 0.3 Tesla). Neodymium magnets are very strong, and it's important to consider their magnetic field strength to avoid saturating the ferrite cores. Here’s how you can assess and manage this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating Magnetic Field Strength of Neodymium Magnets\n",
    "\n",
    "Neodymium magnets can have surface field strengths of up to 1-1.4 Tesla, depending on their grade and size. The exact field strength at a given distance from the magnet's surface can be calculated, but for practical purposes, it’s important to have a rough estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Typical Values**: For a 1-2 cm diameter neodymium magnet, the field strength can be estimated as follows:\n",
    "    - **N42 Grade Magnet**: Surface field of approximately 1.3 Tesla.\n",
    "    - **N52 Grade Magnet**: Surface field of approximately 1.4 Tesla.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Field Distribution**: The field strength decreases with distance from the magnet. At the surface, it is the highest, but it falls off quickly. At a distance of a few millimeters to a centimeter, the field strength will be significantly lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the appropriate diameter of the magnet and the number of fill bars to use so that the larger I-bars do not reach saturation, we need to consider the magnetic flux that the neodymium magnet will generate and ensure it is below the saturation point of the ferrite material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating Magnetic Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saturation Flux Density**: For N87 ferrite material, the saturation flux density $ B_s $ is around 0.3 Tesla.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Core Cross-Sectional Area**:\n",
    "   - The cross-sectional area $ A $ of the larger I-bars (126 x 28 x 20 mm) is 28 mm x 20 mm = 560 mm² or $ 5.6 \\times 10^{-4} $ m².\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnet Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Magnet Strength**:\n",
    "   - Neodymium magnets typically have a surface field strength of 1.0 to 1.4 Tesla.\n",
    "   - The magnetic flux $ \\Phi $ is given by $ B \\times A $, where $ B $ is the magnetic flux density, and $ A $ is the cross-sectional area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flux of Neodymium Magnet**:\n",
    "   - Let's assume you use a magnet with a flux density of 1 Tesla (to stay conservative).\n",
    "   - The magnet's flux $ \\Phi_m $ will be $ B_m \\times A_m $, where $ A_m $ is the cross-sectional area of the magnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Target Flux**:\n",
    "   - To ensure the larger I-bars do not saturate, the flux through them should not exceed $ 0.3 \\, \\text{Tesla} \\times 5.6 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2 = 1.68 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{Weber} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adjusting the Magnet's Area**:\n",
    "   - To achieve a flux of $ 1.68 \\times 10^{-4} $ Weber with a 1 Tesla magnet, the magnet’s area $ A_m $ should be:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     A_m = \\frac{1.68 \\times 10^{-4}}{1 \\, \\text{Tesla}} = 1.68 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - This translates to a cross-sectional area of 168 mm².\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Determining the Diameter**:\n",
    "   - For a circular magnet:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     168 \\, \\text{mm}^2 = \\pi \\times \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{168}{\\pi} \\approx 53.5 \\, \\text{mm}^2\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\frac{d}{2} \\approx 7.3 \\, \\text{mm}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     d \\approx 14.6 \\, \\text{mm}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a magnet with a diameter of approximately 14.6 mm would produce a flux density that is within the saturation limits of your ferrite core.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sheet of the N87 material I used states that at 25 degrees Celsius, the flux density is specified at .49 Tesla and at 120 degrees at .39 Tesla, so 2 cm is just over the saturation limit at room temperature. Please calculate the diameter of the magnet for which the core would go into saturation (0.49 Tesla).\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the diameter of the magnet that would result in the core reaching saturation at a flux density of 0.49 Tesla, we need to ensure the magnetic flux passing through the fill bars and eventually the larger bars does not exceed this saturation limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Given Data:\n",
    "- Saturation flux density of N87 material at 25°C: $ B_{\\text{sat}} = 0.49 \\, \\text{Tesla} $\n",
    "- Cross-sectional area of the fill bars: $ A_{\\text{fill bars}} = 760 \\, \\text{mm}^2 $\n",
    "- Cross-sectional area of the larger bars: $ A_{\\text{big bar}} = 560 \\, \\text{mm}^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Magnetic Flux Density and Cross-Sectional Area Relationship**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\Phi = B \\times A\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   - Where $ \\Phi $ is the magnetic flux (in Weber), $ B $ is the flux density (in Tesla), and $ A $ is the cross-sectional area (in mm²).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Allowable Magnetic Flux**:\n",
    "   - To avoid saturation, the flux density in the larger bars should not exceed 0.49 Tesla.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the allowable magnetic flux $ \\Phi_{\\text{allowable}} $ through the larger bars:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\Phi_{\\text{allowable}} = B_{\\text{sat}} \\times A_{\\text{big bar}} = 0.49 \\, \\text{Tesla} \\times 560 \\, \\text{mm}^2 = 274.4 \\, \\text{Weber}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Magnetic Flux Density in Fill Bars**:\n",
    "   - Since the cross-sectional area of the fill bars is larger, we need to ensure that the total magnetic flux remains below the saturation limit when it eventually spreads to the larger bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Diameter of Magnet for Saturation**:\n",
    "   - Let the diameter of the magnet be $ d $.\n",
    "   - The cross-sectional area $ A_{\\text{magnet}} $ of the magnet:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     A_{\\text{magnet}} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Magnetic Flux Generated by Magnet**:\n",
    "   - For the core to reach saturation, the magnetic flux $ \\Phi_m $ generated by the magnet should be equal to the allowable flux $ \\Phi_{\\text{allowable}} $:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\Phi_m = \\Phi_{\\text{allowable}}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Therefore, the magnetic flux density of the magnet $ B_m $:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     B_m \\times A_{\\text{magnet}} = \\Phi_{\\text{allowable}}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     1 \\, \\text{Tesla} \\times \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} = 274.4 \\, \\text{Weber}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Solving for $ d $:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} = 274.4\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     d^2 = \\frac{4 \\times 274.4}{\\pi}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     d^2 = \\frac{1097.6}{\\pi}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     d^2 \\approx 349.3\n",

    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For the core to reach saturation at 0.49 Tesla, the diameter of the magnet should be approximately 18.7 mm. This ensures that the magnetic flux density generated by the magnet does not exceed the saturation flux density of the N87 material in the core.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "I now measured the magnet I used and it turns out it has a diameter of 17 mm.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the magnet you used has a diameter of 17 mm, we can verify whether this diameter results in the magnetic flux density reaching the saturation point of 0.49 Tesla for the N87 material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recalculated Flux Density for a 17 mm Diameter Magnet\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Magnet Surface Area**:\n",
    "   - Diameter $ d = 17 \\, \\text{mm} $\n",
    "   - Radius $ r = \\frac{d}{2} = 8.5 \\, \\text{mm} $\n",

    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flux Density in Fill Bars**:\n",
    "   - The flux passes through the fill bars with a cross-sectional area of $ 760 \\, \\text{mm}^2 $:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Magnetic Flux Density in Big Bars**: The calculated flux density in the larger bars is approximately 0.405 Tesla.\n",
    "- **Saturation Limit**: This value is below the saturation limit of 0.49 Tesla for the N87 material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a 17 mm diameter magnet works just within the saturation limit for your configuration, confirming that your setup is indeed effective. This explains why you observed the desired behavior without reaching the saturation point.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- The flux density of 0.405 Tesla in the larger bars is within the allowable limit of 0.49 Tesla for N87 ferrite material.\n",
    "- Your observation with a 17 mm diameter magnet confirms that the flux switching works without causing saturation.\n",
