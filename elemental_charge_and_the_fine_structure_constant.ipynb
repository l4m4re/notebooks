    "The vector Laplace operator describes the second spatial derivative in three dimensions, which would be the three dimensional generalization of the one dimensional $d^2/dx^2$, and has a unit of measurement in per meter squared [$/m^2$]. What is very interesting is that together with the quantum circulation constant, we can actually define the time derivative of any given vector field in three dimensional space-time as follows:\n",

    "This is very significant, because it enables us to define higher order Laplace and Poisson equations in three dimensions and it also gives us the opportunity to obtain a much deeper understanding of the Nature of space and time in our Universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the Laplace operator does is establish a Helmholtz decomposition of the vector field $\\vec F$, whereby the term grad div $\\vec F$ results in a **linear** component, the curl free or irrotational field usually denoted $\\vec E$, and the term curl curl $\\vec F$ results in an **angular** component, the divergence free or incompressible field usually denoted $\\vec B$. And these two components may be evaluated independently of one another. \n",

    "The grad div operator in the vector Laplacian can be thought of as a surface integral over a spherical volume   $(4/3) π R^3$, divided by radius R, whereby the limit of R is taken to zero. However, we can compute the same operation without taking the limit of R to zero by computing the radius to volume ratio R/V for such an object, such as a ring vortex with big toroidal radius R and small poloidal radius r, and then use multiplication, provided the fields involved are symmetrical with respect to the surface area of the object. Fortunately, this is the case in this exercise. \n",
