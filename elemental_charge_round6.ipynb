    "multiplying by a few constants, we are sure the fields thus defined are 100%\n",
    "mathematically correct and consistent and free of singularities as well. \n",

    "medium and the integration of the electromagnetic domain with the domain of\n",
    "fluid dynamics, provided we are able to relate the units of measurement used in\n",
    "the electromagnetic domain to those used in the superfluid model, but also\n",

    "What would be the (self propelling) velocity of such a dual torus vortex?\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-propelling velocity of a dual torus vortex in a superfluid medium can be derived from the dynamics of vortex rings. Let's break this down step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-Propelling Velocity of a Single Vortex Ring\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single vortex ring with radius $ R $ and circulation $ \\Gamma $, the self-propelling velocity $ V $ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{\\Gamma}{4 \\pi R} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ \\Gamma $ is the circulation.\n",
    "- $ R $ is the radius of the vortex ring.\n",
    "- $ r_0 $ is the core radius of the vortex ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending to a Dual Torus Vortex\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dual torus vortex, we need to consider the combined effect of the two rings. Given that the rings are counter-rotating and may have a differential in their angular frequencies, we can define the effective circulation as the difference in circulations of the two rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote:\n",
    "- $ \\Gamma_1 $ as the circulation of the first ring.\n",
    "- $ \\Gamma_2 $ as the circulation of the second ring.\n",
    "- $ \\Delta \\Gamma = \\Gamma_1 - \\Gamma_2 $ as the effective circulation for the dual vortex system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the radii $ R $ of both rings are the same and that the circulations are close but with a small differential, the effective circulation $ \\Delta \\Gamma $ can be approximated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\Gamma = \\Gamma - \\Gamma + \\Delta \\omega_t R^2 = 2 \\pi R^2 \\Delta \\omega_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using the formula for the self-propelling velocity of a vortex ring, we can express the self-propelling velocity $ V $ of the dual torus vortex as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{\\Delta \\Gamma}{4 \\pi R} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $ \\Delta \\Gamma = 2 \\pi R^2 \\Delta \\omega_t $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{2 \\pi R^2 \\Delta \\omega_t}{4 \\pi R} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{R \\Delta \\omega_t}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-propelling velocity $ V $ of the dual torus vortex is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{R \\Delta \\omega_t}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ R $ is the radius of the vortex rings.\n",
    "- $ \\Delta \\omega_t $ is the differential angular frequency between the two toroidal rotations.\n",
    "- $ r_0 $ is the core radius of the vortex rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result indicates that the self-propelling velocity of the dual torus vortex depends on the radius $ R $ of the rings, the differential angular frequency $ \\Delta \\omega_t $, and the logarithmic factor involving the ratio of the radius to the core size.\n",

And its unit of measurement evaluates to $[kg/m^3] * [m^2/s] * [m] = [kg/s]$, the unit we assigned to electrical charge. And as can be expected, the unit of measurement for the angular term also works out to $[kg/s]$, so it seems that charge actually has two components, a rather unexpected result that offers deep insight in the actual nature of charge."
