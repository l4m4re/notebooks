    "# Elemental charge and the fine structure constant\n",
    "\n",
    "By Arend Lammertink, MScEE. E-mail: lamare at gmail dot com.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "It is shown that from the assumption that all space is filled with a superfluid medium called aether, characterized by the quantum circulation constant $k$, an elemental particle can be described, characterized by a mass $m={h \\over k}$, with $h$ Planck's constant, and a charge $q*q = e*e$, with e elemental charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is accomplished by assuming this elemental particle to exist in the shape of a single superfluid hollow core ring vortex that plowes itself forward through this superfluid medium and working out the magnitude of momentum $P$ and momentum squared $P^2$ from the known equations describing ring vortices in macroscopic superfluids such as superfluid Helium at near absolute zero temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is shown that from these equations, both the toroidal radius $R$ as well as the hollow core radius $a$ of such an elemental vortex ring particle can be computed, as well as their ratio $\\epsilon = {a \\over R}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, it is shown that by starting from the definition of the fine structure constant $\\alpha$, the definition of elementary charge $e*e$ can be rewritten by multiplying by $m/m$, $R/R$ and $\\pi/\\pi$ such that two terms are obtained, both of which are exactly equal in magnitude to elemental charge $e$, whereby one of the terms represents an angular or magnetic component and the other represents a linear or electric component. And finally, it is shown that the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ can be described as a function of $\\epsilon$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it is shown that the heretofore unexplained nature of the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ can be attributed to the coupling of the linear and angular components of the charge of such an elemental ring vortex, offering a deep understanding of the actual nature of charge to which heretofore a more or less arbitrary unit of measurement, the Coulomb, was assigned. Within the superfluid model we are describing here, however, it is shown that an alternative unit of measurement can be derived for the Coulomb, which is subsequently defined as one kilogram per second [kg/s], allowing an actual physical description of the nature of charge within a model that has only three fundamental units of measurement: the meter [m], the second [s] and the kilogram [kg]. This in contrast to the rather phenomenological description we have today in the form of Maxwell's equations, which are also shown to be formally incorrect using elemental vector math.\n",

    "After the negative result in the famous Michelson–Morley experiment, the at that time prevalent aether theory was abandoned in favor of Einstein's relativity theory. This experiment was based upon the idea that the gravitional force was a force that propagated independently of the electromagnetic forces and thus it was assumed that the movements of planetary bodies through the aether would result in disturbances of the aether, which would influence the speed of light and that should be detectable. When that turned out not to be the case, it unfortunately was the aether theory that was abandoned, while the incorrect assumption that the gravitational force is a force that is independent from the electromagnetic forces is still the prevalent view today. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make matters worse, it turns out that Maxwell made the mistake of entangling the circuit level Faraday law with the fundamental medium model, which resulted in wave equations that were not invariant to the good old Galilean coordinate transform. And it is this mistake that eventually led to the Lorentz transform, which is what eventually led to special relativity. In the words of C.K. Thornhill:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Ref: [Real or Imaginary Space-Time? Reality or Relativity?](https://etherphysics.net/CKT4.pdf) )\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was the mistaken idea, that Maxwell’s equations and the standard wave equation should be invariant, which led, by a mathematical freak, to the Lorentz transform (which demands the non-ether concept and a universally constant wave-speed) and to special relativity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, both k as well as c are arbitrary numbers that define a relationship between the units of measurement we have chosen for length and for time. And in fact, we don't even know if the speed of light can be considered to be constant even in the vacuum, which I consider to be filled with a medium called aether that appears to behave like a superfluid such as Helium at near absolute zero temperatures.\n",
    "One of the consequences of such a view is that I must have an alternative explanation for the negative result of the famous Michelson-Morley experiment. This experiment was based upon the idea that the gravitational force was a force that propagated independently from the electromagnetic forces and it was assumed the aether was stationary and thus it was assumed that the movements of planetary bodies through the aether would result in disturbances of the aether, which would influence the speed of light and that should be detectable:\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment\n",
    "\"The experiment compared the speed of light in perpendicular directions in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether (\"aether wind\").\"\n",
    "When that turned out not to be the case, it unfortunately was the aether theory that was abandoned, while the incorrect assumption that the gravitational force is a force that is independent from the electromagnetic forces is still the prevalent view today.\n",
    "So, if there's no magical gravitational force that can propagate without a medium, we must be able to explain the movements of planetary bodies in such a way that we can also explain the negative result of the MM experiment.\n",
    "And the only way I see to be able to do that is to assume that there are vortices in the aether and that at the surface of a planetary body there is no speed differential between the aether and the planetary body. In other words: we must assume that the aether is not stationary at all, but moves along with planetary bodies and vice versa.\n",
    "And, in the case the situation occurs that some body moves relative to the local aether, a resistance should result such that eventually the difference in speed relative to the local aether dies out. Thus, one would not expect a planetary body to move relative to the aether, for if it once did a long time ago, such differential would decay because of this resistance.\n",
    "Paul Stowe did some calculations a while ago with respect to the so called Pioneer anomaly and showed that the observed deceleration is indeed explainable this way (eq. 44):\n",
    "https://vixra.org/pdf/1310.0237v1.pdf\n",
    "\"Consider the Pioneer spacecraft moving at ~12.5 kps. Its deceleration in this model is therefore predicted to be 8.4E-10 m/sec2. Within experimental error this value matches the actual observed deceleration of both spacecraft.\"\n",
    "Now because of the existence of (irrotational) vortices in the aether implies the existence of a pressure gradient, this on it's turn implies the mass density of the aether to be non-uniform, which on it's turn implies the speed of light to be variable and not constant.\n",
    "Whether or not we would measure the speed of light to be different across the Universe, however, is a totally different question. Even though we can reject the relativity theory because the reason for its existence, Maxwell's bug, no longer applies, clocks that are in orbit definitely run at a different speed than on the ground. This is shown by the GPS system, according to Ron Hatch, who held like 30 patents on GPS and was one of the most outspoken critics of the relativity theory:\n",

    "\n",
    "It is this abstracting away from the underlying physical model, which shaped 20th century physics. With the description of physical phenomena in terms of mathematical field equations, all connection the the underlying models was lost and replaced by an abstract field model. Freeman Dyson expressed this as follows (as quoted by Longair):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Maxwell's theory becomes simple and intelligible only when you give up thinking in terms of mechanical models. Instead of thinking of mechanical objects as primary and electromagnetic stresses as secondary consequences, you must think of the electromagnetic field as primary and mechanical forces as secondary. The idea that the primary constituents of the universe are fields did not come easily to the physicists of Maxwell's generation. Fields are an abstract concept, far removed from the familiar world of things and forces. The field equations of Maxwell are partial differential equations. They cannot be expressed in simple words like Newton's law of motion, force equals mass times acceleration. Maxwell's theory had to wait for the next generation of physicists, Hertz and Lorentz and Einstein, to reveal its power and clarify its concepts. The next generation grew up with Maxwell's equations and was at home in a universe built out of fields. The primacy of fields was as natural to Einstein as the primacy of mechanical structures had been to Maxwell.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put forth a simple question.\n",
    "The electric field is defined as the gradient of the scalar potential Phi.\n",
    "Now vector calculus says that the curl of the gradient of any continuously twice-differentiable scalar field is always the zero vector.\n",
    "Yet Maxwell writes:\n",
    "curl(E) = dB/dt,\n",
    "which is obviously something other than zero for time varying fields.\n",
    "Since they can't be both correct, the question becomes:\n",
    "Which one of the two is incorrect?\n",
    "Maxwell or vector calculus?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There's no inconsistency in Maxwell's equations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there is and it has experimental consequences. Maxwell's equations only predict the existence of one type of EM wave, the Hertzian \"transverse\" wave. In actual fact, there are three types of waves of which two are electromagnetic and one is Tesla's superluminal longitudinal wave that is pure dielectric and has no magnetic component.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we have is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The near field, a non-radiating EM surface wave that is an actual transverse wave propagating on the boundary of two different media;\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The far field, the Hertzian \"transverse\" wave with that mysterious \"wave-particle duality\" and;\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Tesla's superluminal longitudinal mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Steffen Kühn has done some excellent work on superluminal signal transmission:\n",
    "Article General Analytic Solution of the Telegrapher’s Equations and...\n",
    "Preprint Electronic data transmission at three times the speed of lig...\n",
    "Preprint Experimental detection of superluminal far-field radio waves...\n",
    "And the near field surface wave has been applied by Glenn Elmore for single conductor transmission lines:\n",
    "Article Introduction to the Propagating Wave on a Single Conductor\n",
    "This mode is very wide-band and very low loss, because non radiating and zero \"real\" current.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Nor is the presence of first derivatives in them a problem. It's just that, written in the \"conventional\" way, their symmetries aren't obvious and how to resolve the constraints they express, either.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is the fundamental point where we disagree. From my perspective, their symmetries should obviously follow from application of the vector Laplacian, since that defines what I consider a fundamental symmetry between linear (electric) and angular (magnetic) motion, or dynamics if you like, in the form of the well known Helmholtz decomposition.\n",
    "And it is that fundamental symmetry that is broken in Maxwell's equations because of the entanglement of the circuit level Faraday law with the fundamental model of the medium by means of the introduction of the terms already mentioned.\n",
    "And it is this broken symmetry that led to an unexplained error in the strength of the predicted field which was straightened out by the introduction of the fine structure constant.\n",
    "And it is because of the discovery of the quantum circulation constant k, with a value equal to c^2 but a unit of measurement in [m^2/s], that we are able to describe the fundamental dynamics of space time in just two equations that are at a higher abstraction level than Maxwell's equations as well as Navier-Stokes for that matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "[a] = - k nabla^2 [v] and\n",
    "[j] = - k nabla^2 [a].\n",
    "\n",
    "with [j] the jerk, the time derivative of acceleration [a].\n",
    "\n",
    "Or:\n",
    "[F] = - k rho nabla^2 [v] and\n",
    "[Y] = - k rho nabla^2 [a],\n",
    "\n",
    "with Yank density the time derivative of force density in [N/m^3-s].\n",
    "\n",
    "And eventually it is also because of this discovery that we are able to redefine elemental charge in such a way that we can restore the broken symmetry and calculate the fine structure constant accurately.\n",

    "## Definition of the medium\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume all space to be filled with a superfluid like medium, which behavior can be defined by four fundamental constants: the speed of light, the viscosity of the medium, Planck's constant and elementary charge e. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hereby, we define the value of viscosity $\\eta$ by the inverse of vacuum permeability  $μ_0$, which used to be defined as:  $4π×10^{−7}$ H/m.\n",
