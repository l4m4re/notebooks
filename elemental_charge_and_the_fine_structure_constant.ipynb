    "# Elemental charge and the fine structure constant\n",
    "\n",
    "By Arend Lammertink, MScEE. E-mail: lamare at gmail dot com.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "It is shown that from the assumption that all space is filled with a superfluid medium called aether, characterized by the quantum circulation constant $k$, an elemental particle can be described, characterized by a mass $m={h \\over k}$, with $h$ Planck's constant, and a charge $q*q = e*e$, with e elemental charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is accomplished by assuming this elemental particle to exist in the shape of a single superfluid hollow core ring vortex that propells itself forward through this superfluid medium and working out the magnitude of momentum $P$ and momentum squared $P^2$ from the known equations describing ring vortices in macroscopic superfluids such as superfluid Helium at near absolute zero temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is shown that from these equations, both the toroidal radius $R$ as well as the hollow core radius $a$ of such an elemental vortex ring particle can be computed, as well as their ratio $\\epsilon = {a \\over R}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, it is shown that by starting from the definition of the fine structure constant $\\alpha$, the definition of elementary charge $e*e$ can be rewritten by multiplying by $m/m$, $R/R$ and $\\pi/\\pi$ such that two terms are obtained, both of which are exactly equal in magnitude to elemental charge $e$, whereby one of the terms represents an angular or magnetic component and the other represents a linear or electric component. And finally, it is shown that the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ can be described as a function of a/o $\\epsilon$ and $R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it is shown that the heretofore unexplained nature of the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ can be attributed to the coupling of the linear and angular components of the charge of such an elemental ring vortex, offering a deep understanding of the actual nature of charge to which heretofore a more or less arbitrary unit of measurement, the Coulomb, was assigned. Within the superfluid model we are describing here, however, it is shown that an alternative unit of measurement can be derived for the Coulomb, which is subsequently defined as one kilogram per second [kg/s], allowing an actual physical description of the nature of charge within a model that has only three fundamental units of measurement: the meter [m], the second [s] and the kilogram [kg]. This in contrast to the rather phenomenological description we have today in the form of Maxwell's equations."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the negative result in the famous Michelson–Morley experiment, the at that time prevalent aether theory was abandoned in favor of Einstein's relativity theory. This experiment was based upon the idea that the gravitational force was a force that propagated independently from the electromagnetic forces and it was assumed the aether was stationary and thus it was assumed that the movements of planetary bodies through the aether would result in disturbances of the aether, which would influence the speed of light and that should be detectable. When that turned out not to be the case, it unfortunately was the aether theory that was abandoned, while the incorrect assumption that the gravitational force is a force that is independent from the electromagnetic forces is still the prevalent view today. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make matters worse, it turns out that Maxwell made the mistake of entangling the circuit level Faraday law with the fundamental medium model, which resulted in wave equations that were not invariant to the good old Galilean coordinate transform. And it is this mistake that eventually led to the Lorentz transform, which is what eventually led to special relativity. In the words of C.K. Thornhill:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Ref: [Real or Imaginary Space-Time? Reality or Relativity?](https://etherphysics.net/CKT4.pdf) )\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*It was the mistaken idea, that Maxwell’s equations and the standard wave equation should be invariant, which led, by a mathematical freak, to the Lorentz transform (which demands the non-ether concept and a universally constant wave-speed) and to special relativity.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And since special relativity is the currently accepted theory of gravity, it is now widely accepted its predictions do not agree with various astrophysical observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Ref: [Wikipedia - Dark Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) )\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*Various astrophysical observations – including gravitational effects [...] cannot be explained by currently accepted theories of gravity.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite of these results, rather than considering the relativity theory to be disproven and abandoning it, it was concluded that no less than 85% of the mass in the Universe was unaccounted for and was called \"Dark Matter\", because we have thusfar found no way to measure any trace of it: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"*In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the total mass-energy content of the universe contains 5% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter, and 68.2% of a form of energy known as dark energy. Thus, dark matter constitutes 85% of the total mass, while dark energy and dark matter constitute 95% of the total mass-energy content.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, while obviously special relativity is unable to predict gravitational effects on a cosmic scale correctly by a large margin, it does correctly predict the existence of length contraction as well as clock slowing, which is expressed by the Lorentz factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Ref: [Wikipedia - Lorentz factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor) )\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: right;\">(eq. 1)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the question before us is not the fact that length contraction as well as clock slowing are real effects that are a/o responsible for the fact that one will always measure the same speed of light anywhere in the Universe in a local experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question before us is whether that constant speed of light we are measuring implies that the speed of light is constant across the entire Universe, implying on it's turn that time itself is relative via the Lorentz transform, or that there is only an **apparent** constant speed of light, because length contraction and clock slowing cancel one another out in any local measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to the work of Ron Hatch, who held like 12 patents on the GPS technology and was one of the most outspoken critics of the relativity theory because of his work on the actual GPS system:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Ref: [Youtube - Relativity in the Light of GPS Talk 2016](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOQweA_J4S4) )\n",
    "\n",
    "In this speech, he addresses many issues around relativity and the lessons that can be learned from GPS. He proposes an aether theory as an alternative, his modified Lorentz ether theory (MLET), which apparently still considers the aether as being stationary:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Ref: [Clock Behavior and the Search for an Underlying Mechanism for Relativistic Phenomena](http://www.tuks.nl/pdf/Reference_Material/Ronald_Hatch/Hatch-Clock_Behavior_and_theSearch_for_an_Underlying_Mechanism_for_Relativistic_Phenomena_2002.pdf) )\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*The [Lorentz] scale factor, γ, used in SRT with relative velocities is defined in MLET using **absolute velocities**.*\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, he also addresses many issues, including the Sagnac effect, and draws some extraordinary conclusions like this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*The requirement that the sun’s gravitational potential not be applied to clocks resident on or moving in the earth’s inertial frame gives very strong support to the MLET theory. But, even more significant, it **clearly invalidates the Einstein theories**.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the 85% error margin in the prediction of gravitational effects on a cosmic scale isn't already enough of an invalidation, we can add this issue to conclude that it should not have been the aether theory that was abandoned, but rather that it is Einsteinian relativity that should be abandoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottomline, however, is that aether theories can predict the (local) results of the relativity just as well, without requiring time itself to be relative nor the speed of light to be absolutely constant across the entire Universe:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*In an interesting study, Mansouri and Sexl show that in most respects a Lorentz absolute ether theory with length contraction and clock slowing is equivalent to SRT. [...] Thus, SRT has it backwards. It assumes the apparent equivalence of inertial frames is real and uses that result, together with the magic of a universal speed of light, to derive length contraction and clock slowing. On the other hand, the ether theories use the length contraction and clock slowing to show that there is an **apparent** equivalence of all inertial frames and an **apparent** common universal speed of light.*\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to the fundamental relation between space and time in our Universe. In the relativity theory, this fundamental relation is expressed in the form of the Lorentz coordinate transform, which elevates the, as we now know **apparent**, common universal speed of light into an absolute Universal constant that defines a fundamental relation between space and time in such a manner that absolutely nothing can propagate faster than the speed of light in vacuum, even including information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, various anomalies have been reported of the observation of anomalous superlumincal signals, a/o with optical fibres and microwaves. There are 20 references about this in our earlier work that is still on-going and where in the current version the symbol $ν$ instead of $k$ is used for the quantum circulation constant:\n",

For this reason, the solution is also applicable to electrically short cables. Such a model has become indispensable because a few months ago, it was experimentally shown that voltage fluctuations in ordinary but electrically short copper lines move at signal velocities that are significantly higher than the speed of light in a vacuum. This finding **contradicts the statements of the special theory of relativity but not, as is shown here, the fundamental principles of electrical engineering**.*\" \n",

    "\n",
    "At this point, it should be clear that the Einstein-Lorentz paradigm is untenable and that the transmission and reception of superluminal signals is entirely possible, which forces us to reevaluate our fundamental equations and assumptions around the Nature of space and time, as Einstein talked about decades ago:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*All my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundation of physics to this new type of knowledge (Quantum Theory) failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, with **no firm foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which one could have built**.*\" (P. A Schlipp, Albert Einstein: Philosopher – Scientist, On Quantum Theory, 1949) \n",
    "\n",
    "\"*You believe in the God who plays dice, and I in complete law and order in a world which objectively exists, and which I, in a wildly speculative way, am trying to capture. I hope that someone will discover a more **realistic** way, or rather **a more tangible basis** than it has been my lot to find. Even the great initial success of the Quantum Theory does not make me believe in the fundamental dice-game, although I am well aware that our younger colleagues interpret this as a consequence of senility. No doubt the day will come when we will see whose instinctive attitude was the correct one.*\" (Albert Einstein to Max Born, Sept 1944, 'The Born-Einstein Letters') \n",
    "\n",
    "This has now changed, because with the discovery of the quantum circulation constant $k$, which has a value equal to $c^2$ but a unit of measurement in $[m^2/s]$, it has now become possible to formulate such a realistic, tangible and fundamental foundation for our new physics. And this is possible because it turns out we can combine this quantum circulation constant $k$ with the vector Laplacian to define the **time derivative of any given vector field in physical three dimensional space-time** as follows:\n",

    "Obviously, the units of measurements match: $[/s] = [m^2/s] [/m^2]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very significant, because it enables us to define higher order Laplace and Poisson equations in three dimensions and it also gives us the opportunity to obtain a much deeper understanding of the Nature of space and time in our Universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: **this is the fundamental equation that will one day be recognized as one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of the 21st century, because there is simply no argument whatsoever to be made against such a simple and straightforward application of the vector Laplacian**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new foundation, however, is not the main subject of this article. With the new foundation, we can describe a \"firm foundation\" consisting of a number of fields that describe the dynamics of the superfluid medium itself. This answers many questions and highlights the error(s) in Maxwell's equations, but that does not in and of itself explain what particles are or what charge is. \n",
    "\n",
    "And just like with Maxwell's equations we can analyse particular practical situations, such as calculating the magnetic field generated by a current carrying straight wire, we can apply the new theory to calculate a number of parameters of a superfluid vortex ring with an elemental mass $m=h/k$ to find out what that can teach us about the nature of particles as well as elemental charge.\n"

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to describe the dynamics of a superfluid medium using eq. 2 by computing the time derivative of the vector field ${k \\over \\rho} \\vec v$, with $\\vec v$ the velocity field. This results in two vector fields, similar to the familiar $\\vec E$ and $\\vec B$ fields, that have a unit of measurement of force density in $[{N \\over m^3}]$. And we can also compute the time derivatives thereof to define two fields that have a unit of measurement of yank density, the time derivative of force density in $[{N \\over {m^3-s}}]$. Obviously, this way we can describe higher order time derivatives in three dimensions, which was heretofore impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this method is that the resulting potential fields are uniquely defined, leaving no room for \"gauge fixing\". Also, because the resulting fields are obtained by simply writing out the definition of the vector Laplacian, we are sure the fields thus defined are 100% mathematically correct and consistent and free of singularities as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of this method is that there are only three units of measurement, the meter $[m]$, the second $[s]$ and the kilogram $[kg]$, which allows for the straightforward description of the dynamics of the superfluid medium and the integration of the electromagnetic domain with the domain of fluid dynamics, provided we are able to relate the units of measurement used in the electromagnetic domain to those used in the superfluid model, but also provided we are able to either reproduce equations like Coulomb's law and the Lorentz force in a satisfactory manner or explain experimental results using these laws in some other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turned out that the relation of the unit of measurement for charge, the Coulomb, to our model can be derived in a straightforward manner, by the application of Ampere's law to the angular force density field described above, which results in a unit of measurement for current density $\\vec J$ in $[{kg \\over m^3-s^2}]$, resulting in a unit of measurement for charge, the Coulomb, in $[{kg \\over s}]$. This way, one Coulomb is equal to one kilogram per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have so far not been able to reproduce Coulomb's law nor the Lorentz force in a satisfactory manner, which leaves us with open questions around the detailed nature of the Coulomb and Lorentz forces, especially in relation to the nature of charged particles and their mass/charge ratios. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, for the application of our theory to a thin superfluid ring vortex we do not need these two laws, while the rather surprising results probably offer new insights that are helpful in solving these open questions.\n",
