    "multiplying by a few constants, we are sure the fields thus defined are 100%\n",
    "mathematically correct and consistent and free of singularities as well. \n",

    "medium and the integration of the electromagnetic domain with the domain of\n",
    "fluid dynamics, provided we are able to relate the units of measurement used in\n",
    "the electromagnetic domain to those used in the superfluid model, but also\n",

    "I'm afraid we're thinking way too difficult. If we suspect the difference in wave speed between longitudinal compression waves and angular waves through the aether is due to some geometric aspect, we will have to consider the geometric aspects of the differential operators we are working with: the div, grad and curl operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I've been working on a simulator for the new theory, implemented as a staggered Yee grid finite difference simulator in python. The finite difference is the key too digging deeper, since in a discretized context, the geometry matters.  So, rather than forgetting about the underlying geometry of the operators, whereby the limit of the length scale to zero has already been taken, we should consider the geometry for a finite but very small length scale and take the limit of the length scale to zero at the end of the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I'll share the code for the curl operator in the staggered Yee grid finite difference simulator we discussed in another chat. No need to worry about the details of the code, but it's important to understand the importance of the geometric aspects of the curl operators in this context.\n",

The functions you provided indeed compute differences that approximate the line integrals around the edges of grid cells, but they do not include the final scaling step to convert these differences into the curl.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the continuous case, the curl ∇×F⃗∇×F is defined as the circulation per unit area. Thus, in the discrete case, after computing the line integral around a face of the grid cell, you must divide by the area of the face to get the correct approximation of the curl.\" \n",

    "Now let's see what we can find on WP to learn some more:\n",

    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the Helmholtz equation is the **eigenvalue** problem for the **Laplace operator**, where $\\kappa^2$ is the eigenvalue. When the equation is applied to waves, $\\kappa$ is known as the wave number. The Helmholtz equation has a variety of applications in physics and other sciences, including the wave equation, the diffusion equation, and the Schrödinger equation for a free particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the substitution $\\omega = \\kappa c$ relates the wave number to angular frequency $\\omega$ and light speed $c$, which illustrates that light speed c applies to the angular half of the Helmholtz decomposition, while longitudinal waves do not necessarily\n",
    "have to propagate at light speed c.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the physical sciences, the wavenumber (or wave number), also known as repetency, is the **spatial frequency** of a wave, measured in **cycles per unit distance** (ordinary wavenumber) or **radians per unit distance** (angular wavenumber).It is analogous to temporal frequency, which is defined as the number of wave cycles per unit time (ordinary frequency) or radians per unit time (angular frequency). \n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem, because we know the vector Laplacian establishes a Helmholtz decomposition \n",
    "of a vector field into a curl-free (irrotational) component and a divergence-free (solenoidal) component, whereby the curl-free component requires a wave number representing cycles per unit distance, while the divergence-free component requires a wave number representing radians per unit distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "And one cannot have one and the same (eigen)value having two units of measurement at the same time, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "You're correct in noting the challenge of reconciling two different units of measurement for the wave number ($\\kappa$) in the context of the Helmholtz equation. Typically, the wave number $\\kappa$ represents cycles per unit distance (spatial frequency) for the curl-free (irrotational) component, and radians per unit distance (angular frequency) for the divergence-free (solenoidal) component. This distinction arises naturally from the nature of the differential operators (curl and divergence) and their geometric interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "The Helmholtz equation in vector calculus is:\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\vec{F} = -\\kappa^2 \\vec{F} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\kappa$ is the wave number, which traditionally has a single unit associated with it based on the type of wave component being considered:\n",
    "- For curl-free (irrotational) components, $\\kappa$ represents spatial frequency ($ \\text{m}^{-1} $, cycles per meter).\n",
    "- For divergence-free (solenoidal) components, $\\kappa$ represents angular frequency ($ \\text{rad} \\, \\text{m}^{-1} $, radians per meter).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resolution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the challenge where $\\kappa$ appears with two different units:\n",
    "1. **Dimensional Consistency**: Ensure that in your model or simulation, the units of $\\kappa$ are consistent with the type of field it represents:\n",
    "   - For curl-free components, $\\kappa$ should be related to spatial frequencies and have units of $ \\text{m}^{-1} $.\n",
    "   - For divergence-free components, $\\kappa$ should relate to angular frequencies and have units of $ \\text{rad} \\, \\text{m}^{-1} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Separation of Variables**: In the solution process using spherical coordinates (or any coordinate system), differentiate clearly between the components where curl and divergence operations are applied. This separation helps maintain clarity in which component of the vector field each value of $\\kappa$ corresponds to.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coordinate System Choice**: Utilize coordinate systems (such as spherical coordinates) that naturally separate the geometric interpretations of curl and divergence. This facilitates the correct application of the Helmholtz decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, when implementing the Helmholtz equation in a simulation or computational model:\n",
    "- Explicitly define and document the units and interpretations of $\\kappa$ for each component of the vector field.\n",
    "- Ensure that calculations involving $\\kappa$ are consistent with the physical quantities they represent (spatial or angular frequency).\n",
    "- Verify that the discretization of the differential operators (like curl and divergence) in your numerical scheme respects these units and interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By maintaining a clear understanding of the geometric interpretations of curl and divergence, and by correctly assigning units to $\\kappa$ based on the type of field component it represents, you can resolve the issue of having $\\kappa$ with two different units simultaneously. This approach ensures that the Helmholtz equation is properly defined and applicable within the context of your simulation, respecting both physical principles and computational requirements.\n"

    "### Dual Ring Vortex Model in a Superfluid Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, we consider a dual ring vortex where each ring consists of two rotational axes:\n",
    "1. **Toroidal Rotation**: Rotation around the large radius $R$ of the torus.\n",
    "2. **Poloidal Rotation**: Rotation around the small radius $r$ of the torus.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, let's denote the angular frequencies of toroidal rotation by $\\omega_t$ and poloidal rotation by $\\omega_p$. We assume that the toroidal rotations are opposite for the two rings and that there might be a differential in the angular frequencies between the rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rankine Vortex Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Rankine vortex model, the core (rings) is considered a solid body with a rotational motion, while outside the core, the flow is a free vortex. This ensures continuity of velocity at the core boundary.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Here, $\\omega_t$ is the toroidal angular frequency, and $r_c$ is the core radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Free Vortex Outside the Core**:\n",
    "   - For $r > r_c$:\n",
    "     $$ v_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2 \\pi r} $$\n",
    "   - $\\Gamma$ is the circulation, which remains constant for a given vortex ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toroidal and Poloidal Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ring has both toroidal and poloidal rotations. The toroidal rotation ($\\omega_t$) results in circulation around the large radius $R$, and the poloidal rotation ($\\omega_p$) results in circulation around the small radius $r$.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By modeling the dual ring vortex with Rankine vortex dynamics and considering the differential angular frequencies, we can express the fine structure constant in terms of the geometric parameters of the vortex rings. The final expression suggests that the fine structure constant is related to the kinematic viscosity and geometric parameters of the dual ring vortex structure, providing a novel fluid dynamics perspective on $\\alpha$.\n",

    "What would be the (self propelling) velocity of such a dual torus vortex?\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-propelling velocity of a dual torus vortex in a superfluid medium can be derived from the dynamics of vortex rings. Let's break this down step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-Propelling Velocity of a Single Vortex Ring\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single vortex ring with radius $ R $ and circulation $ \\Gamma $, the self-propelling velocity $ V $ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{\\Gamma}{4 \\pi R} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ \\Gamma $ is the circulation.\n",
    "- $ R $ is the radius of the vortex ring.\n",
    "- $ r_0 $ is the core radius of the vortex ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending to a Dual Torus Vortex\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dual torus vortex, we need to consider the combined effect of the two rings. Given that the rings are counter-rotating and may have a differential in their angular frequencies, we can define the effective circulation as the difference in circulations of the two rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote:\n",
    "- $ \\Gamma_1 $ as the circulation of the first ring.\n",
    "- $ \\Gamma_2 $ as the circulation of the second ring.\n",
    "- $ \\Delta \\Gamma = \\Gamma_1 - \\Gamma_2 $ as the effective circulation for the dual vortex system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the radii $ R $ of both rings are the same and that the circulations are close but with a small differential, the effective circulation $ \\Delta \\Gamma $ can be approximated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\Gamma = \\Gamma - \\Gamma + \\Delta \\omega_t R^2 = 2 \\pi R^2 \\Delta \\omega_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using the formula for the self-propelling velocity of a vortex ring, we can express the self-propelling velocity $ V $ of the dual torus vortex as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{\\Delta \\Gamma}{4 \\pi R} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $ \\Delta \\Gamma = 2 \\pi R^2 \\Delta \\omega_t $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{2 \\pi R^2 \\Delta \\omega_t}{4 \\pi R} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{R \\Delta \\omega_t}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-propelling velocity $ V $ of the dual torus vortex is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{R \\Delta \\omega_t}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{8R}{r_0} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ R $ is the radius of the vortex rings.\n",
    "- $ \\Delta \\omega_t $ is the differential angular frequency between the two toroidal rotations.\n",
    "- $ r_0 $ is the core radius of the vortex rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result indicates that the self-propelling velocity of the dual torus vortex depends on the radius $ R $ of the rings, the differential angular frequency $ \\Delta \\omega_t $, and the logarithmic factor involving the ratio of the radius to the core size.\n",

    "vector Laplacian for a ring vortex with mass $m$ and charge $q$, we have shown\n",
    "that electric charge actually has two components, the angular component $q_a$\n",
    "and the linear component $q_l$. When we re-arranged the definition for elemental\n",
    "charge squared, we found the linear term to be equal to our linear charge $q_l$,\n",
    "while the angular term containing the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ is not\n",
    "equal to our angular charge $q_a$ even though it's value is also (almost) equal\n",
    "to the value for elementary charge $e$, confirming that charge actually has two\n",
