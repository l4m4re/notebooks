    "with $h$ Planck's constant, and a charge $q*q = e*e$, with e elemental charge.\n",

    "This is accomplished by assuming this elemental particle to exist in the shape\n",

    "computed, as well as their ratio $\\epsilon = r/R$. \n",

    "\n",
    "It is possible to describe the dynamics of a superfluid medium using eq. 2 by computing the time derivative of the vector field $\\rho k \\vec v$, with $\\vec v$ the velocity field. This results in two vector fields, similar to the familiar $\\vec E$ and $\\vec B$ fields, that have a unit of measurement of force density in $[\\frac{N}{m^3}]$. And we can also compute the time derivatives thereof to define two fields that have a unit of measurement of yank density, the time derivative of force density in $[\\frac{N}{m^3-s}]$. Obviously, this way we can describe higher order time derivatives in three dimensions, which was heretofore impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this method is that the resulting potential fields are uniquely defined, leaving no room for \"gauge fixing\". Also, because the resulting fields are obtained by simply writing out the definition of the vector Laplacian, we are sure the fields thus defined are 100% mathematically correct and consistent and free of singularities as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of this method is that there are only three units of measurement, the meter $[m]$, the second $[s]$ and the kilogram $[kg]$, which allows for the straightforward description of the dynamics of the superfluid medium and the integration of the electromagnetic domain with the domain of fluid dynamics, provided we are able to relate the units of measurement used in the electromagnetic domain to those used in the superfluid model, but also provided we are able to either reproduce equations like Coulomb's law and the Lorentz force in a satisfactory manner or explain experimental results using these laws in some other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turned out that the relation of the unit of measurement for charge, the\n",
    "Coulomb, to our model can be derived in a straightforward manner, by the\n",
    "application of Ampere's law to the angular force density field described above,\n",
    "which results in a unit of measurement for current density $\\vec J$ in\n",
    "$[\\frac{kg} {m^3-s^2}]$, resulting in a unit of measurement for charge, the\n",
    "Coulomb, in $[\\frac{kg}{s}]$. This way, one Coulomb is equal to one kilogram per\n",
    "second.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have so far not been able to reproduce Coulomb's law nor the Lorentz\n",
    "force in a completely satisfactory manner, which leaves us with open questions\n",
    "around the detailed nature of the Coulomb and Lorentz forces, especially in\n",
    "relation to the nature of charged particles and their mass/charge ratios. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, for the application of our theory to a thin superfluid ring vortex we do not need these two laws, while the rather surprising results probably offer new insights that are helpful in solving these open questions.\n",
