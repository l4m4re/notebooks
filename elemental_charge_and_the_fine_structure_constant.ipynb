    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector Laplace operator describes the second spatial derivative in three dimensions, which would be the three dimensional generalization of the one dimensional $d^2/dx^2$, and has a unit of measurement in per meter squared [$/m^2$].\n",
    "\n",
    "What this operator does is establish a Helmholtz decomposition of the vector field **F**, whereby the term grad div **F** results in a **linear** component, the curl free or irrotational field usually denoted **E**, and the term curl curl **F** results in an **angular** component, the divergence free or incompressible field usually denoted **B**. And these two components may be evaluated independently of one another. \n",

    "So when we consider the ratio of charge to mass density $q/ρ$ within this model, we obtain a unit of measurement in $[kg/s] [m^3/kg] = [m^3/s]$, whereby the $m^3$ describes a volume V, so what this ratio describes is a rate of change of the volume V of some charged object per second.\n",

    "The grad div operator in the vector Laplacian can be thought of as a surface integral over a spherical volume   $(4/3) π R^3$, divided by radius R, whereby the limit of R is taken to zero. However, we can compute the same operation without taking the limit of R to zero by computing the radius to volume ratio R/V for such an object, such as a ring vortex with big toroidal radius R and small poloidal radius r, and then use multiplication, provided the fields involved are symmetrical with respect to the surface area of the object. Fortunately, this is the case in this exercise. \n",
